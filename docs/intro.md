# Introduction

MonoLISA is a mnemonic for **monorepo** practice with:

* **L**ayered Libraries
    
* **I**nterface Segregation
    
* **S**ingle Responsibilities
    
* **A**gile Architecture
    

MonoLISA is an architectural pattern for structuring repositories around Clean Code principles. It keeps the codebase easy to understand, change, and deploy in multiple ways.
