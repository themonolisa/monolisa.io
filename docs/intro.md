# Introduction

MonoLISA is a mnemonic for **monorepo** practice with:

* **L**ayered Libraries
    
* **I**nterface Segregation
    
* **S**ingle Responsibilities
    
* **A**gile Architecture
    

MonoLISA is a pattern for crafting code repositories that are easy to understand, change, and deploy to infrastructure in various ways.
